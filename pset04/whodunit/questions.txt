1.  stdin.h is a library containing micros defining datatypes with specific sizes, it is mainly used in hardware coding where using the precise number of bits for the data type is crucial

4.  BM
5.  bi size is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER while bf size is the size of the bitmap file itself
6.  it means that the BMP starts form bottom to top
7.  biBitCount
8.  line 24 if it couldn't open the input file and 32 if it can't open the output file
9.  because the third argument defines who much u need of this data type - struct in our case - which will always be one
10. 3
11. skips a number of steps starting from the reference point in the file
12. it is a type of reference which denotes the current position
